# Form Behavior

## Issue with `&& formControl.touched`

### Cons of adding an the `&& formControl.touched` conditional to a form field error messages

- does not work well with async validators

- does not inform the user of a field being required

## Issue with displaying a `{{ FieldName }} is required message` immediately

It is pushy
